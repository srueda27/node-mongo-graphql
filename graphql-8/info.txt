    so there is a need to filter the data



Advantages
  is stateless -> allows the creation of clusters
  No Under-fetching
  No Over-fecthing
  Schemas and types
  Speeds up development



Disadvantages
  Flexibility adds complexity at first
  Difficult to cache -> the same request can have be send multiple times
