JS is a Synchronous langauge that allowed us to code 
  asynchronous programs by the use of != libraries


Libuv manages the event loop of async I/O 
  the event loop has 4 threads on the Thread Pool
  Libuv uses the OS kernel to make async tasks 
    to avoid using the Thread Pool 


Callback Queue are executed in FIFO order 


There are several Callback Queues one for each phase of the Event Loop
  Event Loop Phases
    Timers
    I/O callbacks
    setImmediate
    Close callbacks -->> close a file o network connection


    Timers 
      setInvertal -->> executes a function repeatedly, every set of time
        needs to be stopped by clearInterval() function
      serTimeout
